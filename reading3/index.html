      I'm not sure whether or not the internet can be a neen like environment. A painting is a representation of something else but it is physical. Part of its beauty is that it is an object that exist alone. Photographic replications donâ€™t do justice to experiencing the art in person.

      In the same way a website is accessed by everyone and it is digital. Which is still real but not real in the same sense that a painting is.

          At least i've never gotten the same experience viewing a website as I have viewing a painting. This might be to the point of the article that its due to the commercialization of the internet that these spaces are not more appreciated and well known. Perhaps the opportunity to create such a space is still up for grabs.
